# Hi, Mom!

Below is the source code of a simple Hello World program written in Rust.

<br />

`main.rs`
```rust
fn main() {
  println!("Hi, Mom!");
}
```

<br />

I'm sorry for your loss, Jeff.

We first create a main function like any other language, and then we add a statement inside the block.

To compile, run:
```haskell
$ rustc main.rs
```

## My Comment

This is my first time entering Rust. I've seen projects like [ruff](https://pypi.org/project/ruff), [rure](https://pypi.org/project/rure) using it, and I guess that ðŸ¦€ crab will take over the world very soon.

(Also, it seems like Rust can be compiled to WA (WebAssembly) because it's a `moz://a` (Mozilla) kind of thing.)

One thing I find quite interesting about Rust is that very few people use it for data science unlike Python or C/C++. I'm certain that Rust and Python, besides the similarities of their syntax, are very different (the latter is a scripting language). But many people use C/C++ for ML (Machine Learning) as well, say [pytorch](https://pypi.org/project/torch) or [mlx](https://pypi.org/project/mlx), and C/C++ is not a scripting language nor compiled like Python.

I'm pretty sure there's a reason for this, and I really hope that [someone can answer this](https://github.com/AWeirdScratcher/learning-rust/issues/new?title=RE:+Why+Rust+Isn't+Used+for+ML).
If it CAN be used for ML, are there any frameworks out there?
